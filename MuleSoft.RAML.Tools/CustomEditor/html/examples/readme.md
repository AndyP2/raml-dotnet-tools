# Examples

Each example must be in its own folder along with its assets ( if any ) and contain an `example.yaml`
with some metadata.

Adding an example.yaml file will result in the example being listed in the [microsite](https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/api-workbench/wiki/Microsite). See https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/api-workbench/issues/661 for more details.

The `example.yaml` file must have the following structure:

```
title: string
description?: string
tags?: string[]
```
